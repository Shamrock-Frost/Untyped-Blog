This blog is a place for me to share awesome Math and Computer Science stuff I'm learning.

# About me

### Brendan Murphy

I'm a 17 year old student dual enrolled in College and High School.
I was a high school intern at Microsot (Research) during the summer of 2017.
I like Emacs, Haskell, Lean, Python, Analysis 1 by Terrence Tao, and Algebra: Chapter 0 by Paolo Aluffi.

Here's a picture of me at a programming contest:
